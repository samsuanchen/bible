1 And I saw a river of water of life, clear as glass, coming out of the high seat of God and of the Lamb,
2 In the middle of its street. And on this side of the river and on that was the tree of life, having twelve sorts of fruits, giving its fruit every month; and the leaves of the tree give life to the nations.
