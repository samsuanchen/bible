1 Then Zophar the Naamathite made answer and said,
2 Are all these words to go unanswered? and is a man seen to be right because he is full of talk?
3 Are your words of pride to make men keep quiet? and are you to make sport, with no one to put you to shame?
4 You may say, My way is clean, and I am free from sin in your eyes.
5 But if only God would take up the word, opening his lips in argument with you;
6 And would make clear to you the secrets of wisdom, and the wonders of his purpose!
7 Are you able to take God's measure, to make discovery of the limits of the Ruler of all?
8 They are higher than heaven; what is there for you to do? deeper than the underworld, and outside your knowledge;
9 Longer in measure than the earth, and wider than the sea.
10 If he goes on his way, shutting a man up and putting him to death, who may make him go back from his purpose?
11 For in his eyes men are as nothing; he sees evil and takes note of it.
12 And so a hollow-minded man will get wisdom, when a young ass of the field gets teaching.
13 But if you put your heart right, stretching out your hands to him;
14 If you put far away the evil of your hands, and let no wrongdoing have a place in your tent;
15 Then truly your face will be lifted up, with no mark of sin, and you will be fixed in your place without fear:
16 For your sorrow will go from your memory, like waters flowing away:
17 And your life will be brighter than day; though it is dark, it will become like the morning.
18 And you will be safe because there is hope; after looking round, you will take your rest in quiet;
19 Sleeping with no fear of danger; and men will be desiring to have grace in your eyes;
20 But the eyes of the evil-doers will be wasting away; their way of flight is gone, and their only hope is the taking of their last breath.
