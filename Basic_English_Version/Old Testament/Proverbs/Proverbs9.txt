1 Wisdom has made her house, putting up her seven pillars.
2 She has put her fat beasts to death; her wine is mixed, her table is ready.
3 She has sent out her women-servants; her voice goes out to the highest places of the town, saying,
4 Whoever is simple, let him come in here; and to him who has no sense, she says:
5 Come, take of my bread, and of my wine which is mixed.
6 Give up the simple ones and have life, and go in the way of knowledge.
7 He who gives teaching to a man of pride gets shame for himself; he who says sharp words to a sinner gets a bad name.
8 Do not say sharp words to a man of pride, or he will have hate for you; make them clear to a wise man, and you will be dear to him.
9 Give teaching to a wise man, and he will become wiser; give training to an upright man, and his learning will be increased.
10 The fear of the Lord is the start of wisdom, and the knowledge of the Holy One gives a wise mind
11 For by me your days will be increased, and the years of your life will be long.
12 If you are wise, you are wise for yourself; if your heart is full of pride, you only will have the pain of it.
13 The foolish woman is full of noise; she has no sense at all.
14 Seated at the door of her house, in the high places of the town,
15 Crying out to those who go by, going straight on their way, she says:
16 Whoever is simple, let him come in here: and to him who is without sense, she says:
17 Drink taken without right is sweet, and food in secret is pleasing.
18 But he does not see that the dead are there, that her guests are in the deep places of the underworld.
