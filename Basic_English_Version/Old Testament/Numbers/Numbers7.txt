1 And when Moses had put up the House completely, and had put oil on it and made it holy, with all the things in it, and had made the altar and all its vessels holy with oil;
2 Then the chiefs of Israel, the heads of their fathers' houses, made offerings; these were the chiefs of the tribes, who were over those who were numbered.
3 And they came with their offerings before the Lord, six covered carts and twelve oxen; a cart for every two of the chiefs, and for every one an ox.
4 And the Lord said to Moses,
5 Take the things from them, to be used for the work of the Tent of meeting; and give them to the Levites, to every man what is needed for his work.
6 So Moses took the carts and the oxen and gave them to the Levites.
7 Two carts and four oxen he gave to the sons of Gershon for their work;
8 And four carts and eight oxen he gave to the sons of Merari for their work, under the direction of Ithamar, the son of Aaron the priest.
9 But to the sons of Kohath he gave nothing; because they had the care of the holy place, taking it about on their backs.
10 And the chiefs gave an offering for the altar on the day when the holy oil was put on it; they made their offering before the altar.
