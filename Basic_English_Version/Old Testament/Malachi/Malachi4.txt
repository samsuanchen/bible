4 Keep in mind the law of Moses, my servant, which I gave him in Horeb for all Israel, even the rules and the decisions.
5 See, I am sending you Elijah the prophet before the day of the Lord comes, that great day, greatly to be feared.
6 And by him the hearts of fathers will be turned to their children, and the hearts of children to their fathers; for fear that I may come and put the earth under a curse.
