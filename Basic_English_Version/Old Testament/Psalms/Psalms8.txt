1 &lt;To the chief music-maker on the Gittith. A Psalm. Of David.&gt; O Lord, our Lord, whose glory is higher than the heavens, how noble is your name in all the earth!
2 You have made clear your strength even out of the mouths of babies at the breast, because of those who are against you; so that you may put to shame the cruel and violent man.
3 When I see your heavens, the work of your fingers, the moon and the stars, which you have put in their places;
4 What is man, that you keep him in mind? the son of man, that you take him into account?
5 For you have made him only a little lower than the gods, crowning him with glory and honour.
6 You have made him ruler over the works of your hands; you have put all things under his feet;
7 All sheep and oxen, and all the beasts of the field;
8 The birds of the air and the fish of the sea, and whatever goes through the deep waters of the seas.
9 O Lord, our Lord, how noble is your name in all the earth!
