1 &lt;Of the sons of Korah. A Psalm. A Song.&gt; This house is resting on the holy mountain.
2 The Lord has more love for the doors of Zion than for all the tents of Jacob.
3 Noble things are said of you, O town of God. (Selah.)
4 Rahab and Babylon will be named among those who have knowledge of me; see, Philistia and Tyre, with Ethiopia; this man had his birth there.
5 And of Zion it will be said, This or that man had his birth there; and the Most High will make her strong.
6 The Lord will keep in mind, when he is writing the records of the people, that this man had his birth there. (Selah.)
7 The players on instruments will be there, and the dancers will say, All my springs are in you.
