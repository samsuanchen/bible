1 Let the Lord be praised. Give praise to the Lord, O my soul.
2 While I have breath I will give praise to the Lord: I will make melody to my God while I have my being.
3 Put not your faith in rulers, or in the son of man, in whom there is no salvation.
4 Man's breath goes out, he is turned back again to dust; in that day all his purposes come to an end.
5 Happy is the man who has the God of Jacob for his help, whose hope is in the Lord his God:
6 Who made heaven and earth, the sea, and all things in them; who keeps faith for ever:
7 Who gives their rights to those who are crushed down; and gives food to those who are in need of it: the Lord makes the prisoners free;
8 The Lord makes open the eyes of the blind; the Lord is the lifter up of those who are bent down; the Lord is a lover of the upright;
9 The Lord takes care of those who are in a strange land; he gives help to the widow and to the child who has no father; but he sends destruction on the way of sinners.
10 The Lord will be King for ever; your God, O Zion, will be King through all generations. Praise be to the Lord.
