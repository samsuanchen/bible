1 &lt;A Song of the going up. Of David.&gt; I was glad because they said to me, We will go into the house of the Lord.
2 At last our feet were inside your doors, O Jerusalem.
3 O Jerusalem, you are like a town which is well joined together;
4 To which the tribes went up, even the tribes of the Lord, for a witness to Israel, to give praise to the name of the Lord.
5 For there seats for the judges were placed, even the rulers' seats of the line of David.
6 O make prayers for the peace of Jerusalem; may they whose love is given to you do well.
7 May peace be inside your walls, and wealth in your noble houses.
8 Because of my brothers and friends, I will now say, Let peace be with you.
9 Because of the house of the Lord our God, I will be working for your good.
