1 &lt;A Song of the going up.&gt; Out of the deep have I sent up my cry to you, O Lord.
2 Lord, let my voice come before you: let your ears be awake to the voice of my prayer.
3 O Jah, if you took note of every sin, who would go free?
4 But there is forgiveness with you, so that you may be feared.
5 I am waiting for the Lord, my soul is waiting for him, and my hope is in his word.
6 My soul is watching for the Lord more than those who are watching for the morning; yes, more than the watchers for the morning.
7 O Israel, have hope in the Lord; for with the Lord is mercy and full salvation.
8 And he will make Israel free from all his sins.
