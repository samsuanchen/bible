1 When Israel came out of Egypt, the children of Jacob from a people whose language was strange to them;
2 Judah became his holy place, and Israel his kingdom.
3 The sea saw it, and went in flight; Jordan was turned back.
4 The mountains were jumping like goats, and the little hills like lambs.
5 What was wrong with you, O sea, that you went in flight? O Jordan, that you were turned back?
6 You mountains, why were you jumping like goats, and you little hills like lambs?
7 Be troubled, O earth, before the Lord, before the God of Jacob;
8 Who made the rock into a water-spring, and the hard stone into a fountain.
