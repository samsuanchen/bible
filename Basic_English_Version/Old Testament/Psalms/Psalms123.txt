1 &lt;A Song of the going up.&gt; To you my eyes are lifted up, even to you whose seat is in the heavens.
2 See! as the eyes of servants are turned to the hands of their masters, and the eyes of a servant-girl to her owner, so our eyes are waiting for the Lord our God, till he has mercy on us.
3 Have mercy on us, O Lord, have mercy on us: for all men are looking down on us.
4 For long enough have men of pride made sport of our soul.
