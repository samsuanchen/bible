1 &lt;To the chief music-maker. A Psalm. Of the sons of Korah.&gt; Lord, you were good to your land: changing the fate of Jacob.
2 The wrongdoing of your people had forgiveness; all their sin had been covered. (Selah.)
3 You were no longer angry: you were turned from the heat of your wrath.
4 Come back to us, O God of our salvation, and be angry with us no longer.
5 Will you go on being angry with us for ever? will you keep your wrath against us through all the long generations?
6 Will you not give us life again, so that your people may be glad in you?
7 Let us see your mercy, O Lord, and give us your salvation.
8 I will give ear to the voice of the Lord; for he will say words of peace to his people and to his saints; but let them not go back to their foolish ways.
9 Truly, his salvation is near to his worshippers; so that glory may be in our land.
10 Mercy and faith have come together; righteousness and peace have given one another a kiss.
11 Faith comes up from the earth like a plant; righteousness is looking down from heaven.
12 The Lord will give what is good; and our land will give its increase.
13 Righteousness will go before him, making a way for his footsteps.
