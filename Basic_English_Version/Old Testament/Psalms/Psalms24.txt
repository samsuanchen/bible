1 &lt;A Psalm. Of David.&gt; The earth is the Lord's, with all its wealth; the world and all the people living in it.
2 For by him it was based on the seas, and made strong on the deep rivers.
3 Who may go up into the hill of the Lord? and who may come into his holy place?
4 He who has clean hands and a true heart; whose desire has not gone out to foolish things, who has not taken a false oath.
5 He will have blessing from the Lord, and righteousness from the God of his salvation.
6 This is the generation of those whose hearts are turned to you, even to your face, O God of Jacob. (Selah.)
7 Let your heads be lifted up, O doors; be lifted up, O you eternal doors: that the King of glory may come in.
8 Who is the King of glory? The Lord of strength and power, the Lord strong in war.
9 Let your heads be lifted up, O doors; let them be lifted up, O you eternal doors: that the King of glory may come in.
10 Who is the King of glory? The Lord of armies, he is the King of glory. (Selah.)
