1 &lt;To the chief music-maker. A Psalm. Of David.&gt; Happy is the man who gives thought to the poor; the Lord will be his saviour in the time of trouble.
2 The Lord will keep him safe, and give him life; the Lord will let him be a blessing on the earth, and will not give him into the hand of his haters.
3 The Lord will be his support on his bed of pain: by you will all his grief be turned to strength.
4 I said, Lord, have mercy on me; make my soul well, because my faith is in you.
5 My haters say evil against me, When will he be dead, and his name come to an end?
6 If one comes to see me, deceit is in his heart; he keeps a store of evil, which he makes public in every place.
7 All my haters are talking secretly together against me; they are designing my downfall.
8 They say, He has an evil disease, which will not let him go: and now that he is down he will not get up again.
9 Even my dearest friend, in whom I had faith, who took bread with me, is turned against me.
10 But you, O Lord, have mercy on me, lifting me up, so that I may give them their punishment.
11 By this I see that you have pleasure in me, because my hater does not overcome me.
12 And as for me, you are my support in my righteousness, giving me a place before your face for ever.
13 May the Lord God of Israel be praised, through eternal days and for ever. So be it. So be it.
