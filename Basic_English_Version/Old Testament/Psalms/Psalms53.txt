1 &lt;To the chief music-maker; put to Mahalath. Maschil. Of David.&gt; The foolish man has said in his heart, God will not do anything. They are unclean, they have done evil works; there is not one who does good.
2 God was looking down from heaven on the children of men, to see if there were any who had wisdom, searching after God.
3 Every one of them has gone back; they are unclean: there is not one who does good, no, not one.
4 Have the workers of evil no knowledge? they take my people for food, as they would take bread; they make no prayer to God.
5 They were in great fear, where there was no cause for fear: for the bones of those who make war on you have been broken by God; you have put them to shame, because God has no desire for them.
6 May the salvation of Israel come out of Zion! When the fate of his people is changed by God, Jacob will have joy, and Israel will be glad.
