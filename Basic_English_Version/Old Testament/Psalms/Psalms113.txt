1 Let the Lord be praised. O you servants of the Lord, give praise to the name of the Lord.
2 Let blessing be on the name of the Lord, from this time and for ever.
3 From the coming up of the sun to its going down, the Lord's name is to be praised.
4 The Lord is high over all nations, and his glory is higher than the heavens.
5 Who is like the Lord our God, who is seated on high,
6 Looking down on the heavens, and on the earth?
7 He takes the poor man out of the dust, lifting him up from his low position;
8 To give him a place among the rulers, even with the rulers of his people.
9 He gives the unfertile woman a family, making her a happy mother of children. Give praise to the Lord.
