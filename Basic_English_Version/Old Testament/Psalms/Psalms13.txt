1 &lt;To the chief music-maker. A Psalm. Of David.&gt; Will you for ever put me out of your memory, O Lord? will your face for ever be turned away from me?
2 How long is my soul to be in doubt, with sorrow in my heart all the day? how long will he who is against me be given power over me?
3 Let my voice come before you, and give me an answer, O Lord my God; let your light be shining on me, so that the sleep of death may not overtake me;
4 And he who is against me may not say, I have overcome him; and those who are troubling me may not be glad when I am moved.
5 But I have had faith in your mercy; my heart will be glad in your salvation.
6 I will make a song to the Lord, because he has given me my reward.
