1 &lt;To the chief music-maker; put to Al-tashheth. Michtam. Of David. When he went in flight from Saul, in the hole of the rock.&gt; Have mercy on me, O God, have mercy on me; for the hope of my soul is in you: I will keep myself safely under the shade of your wings, till these troubles are past.
2 I will send up my cry to the Most High God; to God who does all things for me.
3 He will send from heaven, and take me from the power of him whose desire is for my destruction. God will send out his mercy and his good faith.
4 My soul is among lions; I am stretched out among those who are on fire, even the sons of men, whose teeth are spears and arrows, and whose tongue is a sharp sword.
5 O God, be lifted up higher than the heavens; let your glory be over all the earth.
6 They have made ready a net for my steps; my soul is bent down; they have made a great hole before me, and have gone down into it themselves. (Selah.)
7 My heart is fixed, O God, my heart is fixed; I will make songs, and give praise.
8 You are my glory; let the instruments of music be awake; I myself will be awake with the dawn.
9 I will give you praise, O Lord, among the peoples; I will make songs to you among the nations.
10 For your mercy is great, stretching up to the heavens, and your righteousness goes up to the clouds.
11 Be lifted up, O God, higher than the heavens, let your glory be over all the earth.
