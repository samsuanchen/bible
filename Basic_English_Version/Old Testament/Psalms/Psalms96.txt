1 O make a new song to the Lord; let all the earth make melody to the Lord.
2 Make songs to the Lord, blessing his name; give the good news of his salvation day by day.
3 Make clear his glory to the nations, and his wonders to all the peoples.
4 For the Lord is great, and greatly to be praised; he is more to be feared than all other gods.
5 For all the gods of the nations are false gods; but the Lord made the heavens.
6 Honour and glory are before him: strong and fair is his holy place.
7 Give to the Lord, O you families of the peoples, give to the Lord glory and strength.
8 Give to the Lord the glory of his name; take with you an offering and come into his house.
9 O give worship to the Lord in holy robes; be in fear before him, all the earth.
10 Say among the nations, The Lord is King; yes, the world is ordered so that it may not be moved; he will be an upright judge of the peoples.
11 Let the heavens have joy and the earth be glad; let the sea be thundering with all its waters;
12 Let the field be glad, and everything which is in it; yes, let all the trees of the wood be sounding with joy,
13 Before the Lord, for he is come; he is come to be the judge of the earth; the earth will be judged in righteousness, and the peoples with unchanging faith.
