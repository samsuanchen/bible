1 &lt;A Song of the going up. Of David.&gt; See how good and how pleasing it is for brothers to be living together in harmony!
2 It is like oil of great price on the head, flowing down over the face, even Aaron's face: coming down to the edge of his robe;
3 Like the dew of Hermon, which comes down on the mountains of Zion: for there the Lord gave orders for the blessing, even life for ever.
