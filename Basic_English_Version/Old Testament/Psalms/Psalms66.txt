1 &lt;To the chief music-maker. A Song. A Psalm.&gt; Send up a glad cry to God, all the earth:
2 Make a song in honour of his name: give praise and glory to him.
3 Say to God, How greatly to be feared are your works! because of your great power your haters are forced to put themselves under your feet.
4 Let all the earth give you worship, and make songs to you; let them make songs to your name. (Selah.)
5 Come and see the works of God: he is to be feared in all he does to the children of men.
6 The sea was turned into dry land: they went through the river on foot: there did we have joy in him.
7 He is ruling in power for ever; his eyes are watching the nations: may his haters have no strength against him. (Selah.)
8 Give blessings to our God, O you peoples, let the voice of his praise be loud;
9 Because he gives us life, and has not let our feet be moved.
10 For you, O God, have put us to the test: testing us by fire like silver.
11 You let us be put in prison; chains were put on our legs.
12 You let men go driving over our heads; we went through fire and through water; but you took us out into a wide place.
13 I will come into your house with burned offerings, I will make payment of my debt to you,
14 Keeping the word which came from my lips, and which my mouth said, when I was in trouble.
15 I will give you burned offerings of fat beasts, and the smoke of sheep; I will make offerings of oxen and goats. (Selah.)
16 Come, give ear to me, all you God-fearing men, so that I may make clear to you what he has done for my soul.
17 My voice went up to him, and I was lifted up from the underworld.
18 I said in my heart, The Lord will not give ear to me:
19 But truly God's ear has been open; he has give attention to the voice of my prayer.
20 Praise be to God who has not taken away his good faith and his mercy from me.
