1 &lt;A Psalm. Of David. When he went in flight from Absalom his son.&gt; Lord, how greatly are they increased who make attacks on me! in great numbers they come against me.
2 Unnumbered are those who say of my soul, There is no help for him in God. (Selah.)
3 But your strength, O Lord, is round me, you are my glory and the lifter up of my head.
4 I send up a cry to the Lord with my voice, and he gives me an answer from his holy hill. (Selah.)
5 I took my rest in sleep, and then again I was awake; for the Lord was my support.
6 I will have no fear, though ten thousand have come round me, putting themselves against me.
7 Come to me, Lord; keep me safe, O my God; for you have given all my haters blows on their face-bones; the teeth of the evil-doers have been broken by you.
8 Salvation comes from the Lord; your blessing is on your people. (Selah.)
