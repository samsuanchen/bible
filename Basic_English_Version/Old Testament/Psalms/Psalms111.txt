1 Let the Lord be praised. I will give praise to the Lord with all my heart, among the upright, and in the meeting of the people.
2 The works of the Lord are great, searched out by all those who have delight in them.
3 His work is full of honour and glory; and his righteousness is unchanging for ever.
4 Certain for ever is the memory of his wonders: the Lord is full of pity and mercy.
5 He has given food to his worshippers; he will keep his agreement in mind for ever.
6 He has made clear to his people the power of his works, giving them the heritage of the nations.
7 The works of his hands are faith and righteousness; all his laws are unchanging.
8 They are fixed for ever and ever, they are done in faith and righteousness.
9 He has sent salvation to his people; he has given his word for ever: holy is his name and greatly to be feared.
10 The fear of the Lord is the best part of wisdom: all those who keep his laws are wise: his praise is eternal.
