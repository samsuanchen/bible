1 &lt;A Psalm. Of David. When he was in the waste land of Judah.&gt; O God, you are my God; early will I make my search for you: my soul is dry for need of you, my flesh is wasted with desire for you, as a dry and burning land where no water is;
2 To see your power and your glory, as I have seen you in the holy place.
3 Because your mercy is better than life, my lips will give you praise.
4 So will I go on blessing you all my life, lifting up my hands in your name.
5 My soul will be comforted, as with good food; and my mouth will give you praise with songs of joy;
6 When the memory of you comes to me on my bed, and when I give thought to you in the night-time.
7 Because you have been my help, I will have joy in the shade of your wings.
8 My soul keeps ever near you: your right hand is my support.
9 But those whose desire is my soul's destruction will go down to the lower parts of the earth.
10 They will be cut off by the sword; they will be food for foxes.
11 But the king will have joy in God; everyone who takes an oath by him will have cause for pride; but the false mouth will be stopped.
