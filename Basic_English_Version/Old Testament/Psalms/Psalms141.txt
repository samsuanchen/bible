1 &lt;A Psalm. Of David.&gt; Lord, I have made my cry to you; come to me quickly; give ear to my voice, when it goes up to you.
2 Let my prayer be ordered before you like a sweet smell; and let the lifting up of my hands be like the evening offering.
3 O Lord, keep a watch over my mouth; keep the door of my lips.
4 Keep my heart from desiring any evil thing, or from taking part in the sins of the evil-doers with men who do wrong: and let me have no part in their good things.
5 Let the upright give me punishment; and let the god-fearing man put me in the right way; but I will not let the oil of sinners come on my head: when they do evil I will give myself to prayer.
6 When destruction comes to their judges by the side of the rock, they will give ear to my words, for they are sweet.
7 Our bones are broken up at the mouth of the underworld, as the earth is broken by the plough.
8 But my eyes are turned to you, O Lord God: my hope is in you; let not my soul be given up to death.
9 Keep me from the net which they have put down for me, and from the designs of the workers of evil.
10 Let the sinners be taken in the nets which they themselves have put down, while I go free.
