1 &lt;Of David. Maschil.&gt; Happy is he who has forgiveness for his wrongdoing, and whose sin is covered.
2 Happy is the man in whom the Lord sees no evil, and in whose spirit there is no deceit.
3 When I kept my mouth shut, my bones were wasted, because of my crying all through the day.
4 For the weight of your hand was on me day and night; my body became dry like the earth in summer. (Selah.)
5 I made my wrongdoing clear to you, and did not keep back my sin. I said, I will put it all before the Lord; and you took away my wrongdoing and my sin. (Selah.)
6 For this cause let every saint make his prayer to you at a time when you are near: then the overflowing of the great waters will not overtake him.
7 You are my safe and secret place; you will keep me from trouble; you will put songs of salvation on the lips of those who are round me. (Selah.)
8 I will give you knowledge, teaching you the way to go; my eye will be your guide.
9 Do not be like the horse or the ass, without sense; ...
10 The sinner will be full of trouble; but mercy will be round the man who has faith in the Lord.
11 Be glad in the Lord with joy, you upright men; give cries of joy, all you whose hearts are true.
