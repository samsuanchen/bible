1 &lt;A Song of the going up. Of David.&gt; If it had not been the Lord who was on our side (let Israel now say);
2 If it had not been the Lord who was on our side, when men came up against us;
3 They would have made a meal of us while still living, in the heat of their wrath against us:
4 We would have been covered by the waters; the streams would have gone over our soul;
5 Yes, the waters of pride would have gone over our soul.
6 Praise be to the Lord, who has not let us be wounded by their teeth.
7 Our soul has gone free like a bird out of the net of those who would take her: the net is broken, and we are free.
8 Our help is in the name of the Lord, the maker of heaven and earth.
