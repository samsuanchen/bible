1 &lt;A Song of the going up.&gt; Great have been my troubles from the time when I was young (let Israel now say);
2 Great have been my troubles from the time when I was young, but my troubles have not overcome me.
3 The ploughmen were ploughing on my back; long were the wounds they made.
4 The Lord is true: the cords of the evil-doers are broken in two.
5 Let all the haters of Zion be shamed and turned back.
6 Let them be like the grass on the house-tops, which is dry before it comes to full growth.
7 He who gets in the grain has no use for it; and they do not make bands of it for the grain-stems.
8 And those who go by do not say, The blessing of the Lord be on you; we give you blessing in the name of the Lord.
