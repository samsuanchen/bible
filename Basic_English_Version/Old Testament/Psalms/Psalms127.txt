1 &lt;A Song of the going up. Of Solomon.&gt; If the Lord is not helping the builders, then the building of a house is to no purpose: if the Lord does not keep the town, the watchman keeps his watch for nothing.
2 It is of no use for you to get up early, and to go late to your rest, with the bread of sorrow for your food; for the Lord gives to his loved ones in sleep.
3 See, sons are a heritage from the Lord; the fruit of the body is his reward.
4 Like arrows in the hand of a man of war, are the children of the young.
5 Happy is the man who has a good store of them; he will not be put to shame, but his cause will be supported by them against his haters.
