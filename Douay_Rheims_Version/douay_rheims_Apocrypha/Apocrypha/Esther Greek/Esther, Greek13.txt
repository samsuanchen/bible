8 But Mardochai besought the Lord, remembering all his works, 
9 And said: O Lord, Lord, almighty king, for all things are in thy power, and there is none that can resist thy will, if thou determine to save Israel. 
10 Thou hast made heaven and earth, and all things that are under the cope of heaven. 
11 Thou art Lord of all, and there is none that can resist thy majesty. 
12 Thou knowest all things, and thou knowest that it was not out of pride and contempt, or any desire of glory, that I refused to worship the proud Aman, 
13 (For I would willingly and readily for the salvation of Israel have kissed even the steps of his feet,) 
14 But I feared lest I should transfer the honour of my God to a man, and lest I should adore any one except my God. 
15 And now, O Lord, O king, O God of Abraham, have mercy on thy people, be- cause our enemies resolve to destroy us, and extinguish thy inheritance. 
16 Despise not thy portion, which thou hast redeemed for thyself out of Egypt. 
17 Hear my supplication, and be merciful to thy lot and inheritance, and turn our mourning into joy, that we may live and praise thy name, 0 Lord, and shut not the mouths of them that sing to thee. 
18 And all Israel with like mind and supplication cried to the Lord, because they saw certain death hanging over their heads.
