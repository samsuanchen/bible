1 A psalm for David himself. The Lord hath reigned, let the people be angry: he that sitteth on the cherubims: let the earth be moved. 
2 The Lord is great in Sion, and high above all people. 
3 Let them give praise to thy great name: for it is terrible and holy: 
4 and the king's honour loveth judgment. Thou hast prepared directions: thou hast done judgment and justice in Jacob. 
5 Exalt ye the Lord our God, and adore his footstool, for it is holy. 
6 Moses and Aaron among his priests: and Samuel among them that call upon his name. They called upon the Lord, and he heard them: 
7 he spoke to them in the pillar of the cloud. They kept his testimonies, and the commandment which he gave them. 
8 Thou didst hear them, O Lord our God: thou wast a merciful God to them, and taking vengeance on all their inventions. 
9 Exalt ye the Lord our God, and adore at his holy mountain: for the Lord our God is holy.
