12 Praise the Lord, O Jerusalem: praise thy God, O Sion. 
13 Because he hath strengthened the bolts of thy gates, he hath blessed thy children within thee. 
14 Who hath placed peace in thy borders: and filleth thee with the fat of corn. 
15 Who sendeth forth his speech to the earth: his word runneth swiftly. 
16 Who giveth snow like wool: scattereth mists like ashes. 
17 He sendeth his crystal like morsels: who shall stand before the face of his cold? 
18 He shall send out his word, and shall melt them: his wind shall blow, and the waters shall run. 
19 Who declareth his word to Jacob: his justices and his judgments to Israel. 
20 He hath not done in like manner to every nation: and his judgments he hath not made manifest to them. Alleluia.
