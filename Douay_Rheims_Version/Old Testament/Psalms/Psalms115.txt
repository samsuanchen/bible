10 I have believed, therefore have I spoken; but I have been humbled exceedingly. 
11 I said in my excess: Every man is a liar. 
12 What shall I render to the Lord, for all the things he hath rendered unto me? 
13 I will take the chalice of salvation; and I will call upon the name of the Lord. 
14 I will pay my vows to the Lord before all his people: 
15 precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his saints. 
16 O Lord, for I am thy servant: I am thy servant, and the son of thy handmaid. Thou hast broken my bonds: 
17 I will sacrifice to thee the sacrifice of praise, and I will call upon the name of the Lord. 
18 I will pay my vows to the Lord in the sight of all his people: 
19 in the courts of the house of the Lord, in the midst of thee, O Jerusalem.
