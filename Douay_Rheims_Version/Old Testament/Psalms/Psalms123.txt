1 If it had not been that the Lord was with us, let Israel now say: 
2 If it had not been that the Lord was with us, When men rose up against us 
3 perhaps they had swallowed us up alive. When their fury was enkindled against us, 
4 perhaps the waters had swallowed us up. 
5 Our soul hath passed through a torrent: perhaps our soul had passed through a water insupportable. 
6 Blessed be the Lord, who hath not given us to be a prey to their teeth. 
7 Our soul hath been delivered as a sparrow out of the snare of the followers. The snare is broken, and we are delivered. 
8 Our help is in the name of the Lord, who made heaven and earth.
