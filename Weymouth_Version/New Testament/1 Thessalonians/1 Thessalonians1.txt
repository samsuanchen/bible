1 Paul,  Silas, and Timothy: To the Church  of the Thessalonians which is in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. May grace and peace be granted to you.
2 We continually give thanks to God because of you all, while we make mention of you in our prayers.
3 For we never fail to remember your works of faith and labours of love and your persistent and unwavering hope in our Lord Jesus Christ in the presence of our God and Father;
4 knowing as we do, brethren, that you are beloved by God and that He has chosen you.
5 The Good News that we brought you did not come to you in words only, but also with power and with the Holy Spirit and with much certainty, for you know the sort of men we became among you, as examples for your sakes.
6 And you followed the pattern set you by us and by the Master, after you had received the Message amid severe persecution, and yet with the joy which the Holy Spirit gives,
7 so that you became a pattern to all the believers throughout Macedonia and  Greece.
8 For it was not only from you that the Master's Message  sounded forth throughout Macedonia and  Greece; but everywhere your faith in God has become known, so that it is unnecessary for us to say anything about it.
9 For when  others speak of us they report the reception we had from you, and how you turned from your idols to God, to be bondservants of the true and ever-living God,
10 and to await the return from Heaven of His Son, whom He raised from among the dead--even Jesus, our Deliverer from God's coming anger.
